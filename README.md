# MITM

This was a project done in Python for our Routing and Switching final project.

## What does it do?
It uses ARP table poisoning to sniff the packets of two hosts on your network using a Man In the Middle attack.

### Note
This only works on Linux due to commands needed. Also some of the low level socket stuff only worked on Linux.
